    <h1 class="about">About</h1>
    <p>Petr is just an ordinary guy who is trying to become a front-end web developer, who loves well-designed hi-tech items and can get easily stuck at listening to music from a proper hi-fi audio sound system.
    </p>
    <p>He likes minimalistic but meaningful design and art, electronic music, good food and dark honest sarcastic humour.
    </p>

    <p>He originally comes from the Czech Republic but currently lives in Sydney, Australia. He is an alumnus from the Central Queensland University campus in Sydney.
    </p>

    <p>He seeks to be inspired, to envision the unlikely, to work hard for things that are worth it, and to be surrounded by those who bring out the best in me.
